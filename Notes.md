# Data Structures And Algorithms in JavaScript

### Data Structuers
-   Array
-   Object
-   Set
-   Map
-   Stack
-   Queue
-   Circular Queue
-   Linked List
-   Linked List Stack
-   Linked List Queue
-   Doubly Linked List
-   Hash Table
-   Tree
-   Graph

### Tree 

Hierarchical consisting of nodes connected by edeges 

Non-linear data structure unlike linked-list ,array , stacks ,queues 

#### Terminolgy 
- Root Node (Do not have parent nodes)
- Parent Node 
- Child Node
- Leaf Node (Do not have child nodes )
- Degree of node is total number of child nodes it has 
- Degree of tree is maxmum number of nodes
- Depth of Node is number of edeges to that node
- Depth of root is alwyas 0 
- Height of root node is considered height of tree

#### Binary Search tree

- Value of left node must be smaller than parent 
- Value of right node must be greater than parent
